> DoobooIAP repo aims to create full featured example app for in app purchase with [react-native-iap](https://github.com/dooboolab/react-native-iap). Bringing up the [issue provided in react-native-iap](https://github.com/dooboolab/react-native-iap/issues/855), we'd like to fully generate working example app.

### Running the project

Running the project is as simple as running

```sh
yarn start
```

This runs the `start` script specified in our `package.json`, and will spawn off a server which reloads the page as we save our files.
Typically the server runs at `http://localhost:8080`, but should be automatically opened for you.

## Testing the project

Testing is also just a command away:

```sh
yarn test
```
